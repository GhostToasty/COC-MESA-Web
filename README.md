# COC-MESA-Web

This was originally a collaborate project between Chris Taguba, Emiliano Ruiz, and Alyssa Calleros. This project was made to learn more about web development in efforts for College of the Canyon's MESA Skills Lab - Web Development Lab. 

All files present are made by me except for index.html, animate.js, and script.js and it's respective CSS. All other files not made by Alyssa Calleros have been removed from this specific iteration of the project.
